[This site](https://javelin1992.github.io/Deep-Learning/) is created to record and share my personal journey of studying and  exploring the rapidly changing field of deep learning, and it's primarily organized into two parts. The first part will contain links towards various projects which I have undertaken either for relevant online courses or to sate my personal curiosity, while the second part will contain links to blogs, papers and other side materials which I personally find both thought-provoking and illuminating.

content will be updated regularly.
